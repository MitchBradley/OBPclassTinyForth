# OBP Class Tiny Forth

This is an extremely rudimentary Forth interpreter/compiler for
teaching purposes.

It has only the most basic elements of Forth, namely the
interpreter/compiler loop and a few simple words.  It is optimized
only for simplicity and clarity, not for functionality or performance.

It is known to compile on Windows under mingw-w64 in 32-bit mode,
and has not been tested anywhere else.
